1.	What do we mean when we talk about a program’s “lifecycle?”
* You can describe a program’s lifecycle as the flow of commands and operations that it goes through when the page is loaded to when a user clicks on something. It executes until it has no other commands left to execute. We an visualize this a little easier when we look at how are files start with a document, html, body, and so on.
2.	What does “runtime” mean?
* When we say runtime, we refer to what the computer is doing in the current moment. It is executing code and continues to do so as the user interacts or it is told to stop doing so, which might be like closing the browser for example.
1.	In JavaScript, what is a function and when might you want to create one?
* A function is a type of command or statement that elicits an answer in the form of a task or value when the function is called. 
2.	In CSS, what is the difference between a class and an id?
* A class is preceded by a “.” and an ID is preceded by an “#”. An ID is particular to one element while a class can have multiple.
3.	In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why?
* The order of the elements do matter because that is the order in which they are being loaded on the page with html files. 
4.	When might you need to use an array? How about an object?
* Using an array is very common when you’re listing values like names or numbers or coordinates to give a map a center point. An object is a set of “key:value” pairs that describes something, it gives it its properties. Someone might use objects to describe the various names in the array they previous created.
