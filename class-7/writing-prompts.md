### Web app cartography 
1.	 Color plays a significant role in the visualization of map data. What are some important considerations to keep in mind when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map?
* Choosing the right colors means not choosing colors that are too similar to one another and inhibit the user’s ability to read the map. Bright colors with bright colors are is not ideal. Using a color ramp, depending on what you’re trying to show, is a good way to decide on appropriate colors. Using colors that stand out and are easily distinguishable is important
2.	Why might you want to avoid using a rainbow color scheme?
* If you’re trying to show an population densities in certain areas or a suitability analysis, using a rainbow scheme is not advised. You want to have the user look at the legend once and understand it. If they have to go back and look at each color and its values every time, it’s not a good choice of color. Rainbows do not show a clear delineation from one value to the next.
3.	List and describe 2-3 different thematic map types
* Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate. A multivariate map takes multiple data themes and combines them for one overall map symbol. A univariate map displays one set of data, resulting in the use of only one color-ramp “column.” A bivariate map combines two datasets and results in a color ramp that is more of a grid with columns and rows. It can also result in a single color ramp with some other symbol that is overlayed with each color ramp value.
4.	What type of data is appropriately respresented by a sequential color scheme? What about a diverging color scheme?
* A sequential color scheme can be used to display density analysis such as population and income… things that go from less to more. Diverging color schemes can be used to show site suitability analysis. Whether a site is considered suitable of not can be two completely different colors like red and green, usually showing a scale that is both above and below an average.
5.	Can you name any tools (either from the presentation or your web travels) that would be helpful for choosing colors?
* Kuler is a web application supported by esri that can help you create color schemes for your map. Another application like Colorpic can help pick appropriate colors.
### CORS and working with external data
1.	In your own words, describe why web map developers have to think about CORS.
* Developers have to think about CORS because not everyone has access to the data the map is drawing from. Access issues arise often and developers need a way around it.
2.	What is the concept of "separation of concerns?"
* The separation of concerns is a concept in coding that reduces complexity within the code. By only creating smaller portions of code, the writer is able to break down large applications. Each module or layer should be responsible for one thing.
