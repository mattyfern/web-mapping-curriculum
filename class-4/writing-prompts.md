1.	What does client-side rendering mean in the context of web maps?
-	Client side rendering in web maps means maps are processed on the clients computer. The speed at which the map loads and its resolution depends on the client and their processing power. 
2.	Why is it possible for Mapbox GL JS to place labels dynamically as you interact with the map?
-	It is possible for Mapbox GL JS to place labels dynamically because rendering maps comes from the client. Because Mapbox uses client-side rendering, maps respond and display data 

1.	Describe how feature gets to the makeFeatureLabel() function.
-	Using the featuretohtml  function, it takes data and puts it into a more user-friendly html format. Which can then be made into an appropriate label with feature label function.
2.	What does the getDistrictNumber() function do?
-	This function returns the district number from specifically associated data in a map layer.
3.	Looking at the callback to map.on('click',...), what is e and why do we need it?
-	E is an element. This is important because it significantly amplies the amount of interaction in a map. Rather than only being able to click on one thing, users can click on different elements (e), and the map will return corresponding information. The user determines what element is clicked.
