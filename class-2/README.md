__Homework__

For your class journal:

1. What is the difference between raster and vector data?
* Vector data involves x and y coordinates and includes lines and polygons. Raster data is continuous and assigns each pixel in the map a value. 

2. Why do "slippy maps" exist?
*Slippy maps exist because they paved the path for new web maps. After the tile was introduced, a computer only had to load the tiles of the map that the view was currently on. Zooming the map in or out multiplied the times or divided them. Smart maps would preload tiles along the borders of the map to help the smoothness of the interface.

3. Why would you want to install a dedicated text editor?
*Dedicated text editors don’t just let you write code, they help you write code. They can predict functions and highlight syntax and good ones can execute and debug code.

4. What is Leaflet?
*Leaflet is an open-source JS library for maps. It can load GeoJSON files like we used in class

5. How has web map rendering changed over the years?
*Web map rendering went from loading an entire map to just loading individual tiles that are in current view. On old maps, you had to render an entire map and reload it every time you moved it. Nowadays, the interface only renders the map tiles that it needs and a couple extra. The real difference between the two is the speed at which a computer could render the images. 

6. What is the basemap-overlay paradigm and how are GL maps different?
*The basemap-overlay paradigm came after the creation of tiles. The basemap is made of map tiles that show the immediate area and surroundings essentially. The overlay side of that is the content that a user can add to the basemap. Feature layers and content layers allow the user to build out various parts of the map for analysis and display.

Exercises to do on your own:

1. Keep learning! Try one more of the Web apps tutorials on the [Mapbox help page](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/#web-apps) and submit your completed tutorial to your GitHub project.
2. Head to the [Mapbox GL JS examples page](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) and pick two examples under the user interactions section. What kind of interactions do you see? Why might you use each of those interactions?
*They have interactions that allow you to slide a timescale and change the information displayed based on zoom level. They also have interactions that allow you to change opacity in a layer and measure distances. Changing opacity could help you display data that is not obvious from topmost layer and to show change from one layer to another. Timescales help show change over time and changing data on zoom levels helps to get a bigger picture of a dataset as well as up close.

3. If you didn’t finish the “code together” exercise, please do so before next week.


__Project__

Choose a project idea and open an issue in your GitHub repo describing what it is. Your description should include:

1. The topic you will focus on (one of: housing and homelessness, wildfires, or fracking.)
2. A description of your audience.
3. At least three questions you hope to be able to answer for your audience.
