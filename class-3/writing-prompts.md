Intro to interactivity
•	What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?
Map developers can create interactive maps that do not have interactions that overlap with each other. For instance, having a hover popup and click popup. They can also organize different interactions around the page in a clear way using understandable labeling from the users perspective. Not throwing interactions in the users face and letting them explore it themselves is also less stressful.
•	Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”
When someone uses a map, it is implied that they can interact with it and come to their own conclusions and findings with the functions the map includes. Map readers take conclusions from a map that is used to show one specific thing.
Common types of interaction
•	What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?
Geocoding uses coordinates to find specific places for a user in a readable way. Things like markers and positioning on a map are examples of geocoding.
Intro to events
•	What is an event?
An event is an object that contains information on something that just happened between the user and map.
•	Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.
An event listener is a function whose job is to make something happen after something else happens. A good example is when a user clicks on something in the map and a popup appears in response.
